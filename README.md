# Royalty-Free-Music

A tool for Downloading the Royalty Free Music

<h1>Music Hub</h1>
<p>Music Hub is a free and open-source web application created in Next.js 12, with Ant Design, TypeScript, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. It allows users to download copyright-free music in various genres and styles. The app features a search function that enables users to quickly find the type of music they are looking for, as well as audio previews of each track, so users can listen to a sample before downloading.</p>

<h1>Working</h1>
<p>It's an advanced and intricate digital platform built in Next.js 12( used as a full stack framework ) with Ant Design, TypeScript, Express, and Puppeteer, utilizing OAuth 2.0 and Google APIs.
</p>

<p>The project allows users to freely download music, sound effects, and short clips. </p>

<p>The complexity lies in its backend operations, where it efficiently scrapes content from selected websites using Puppeteer, organizes it in Google Sheets via Google APIs, and serves it to clients via a REST API.</p>

<p>The frontend, developed in Next.js, elegantly presents curated data including titles, thumbnails, media URLs, and descriptions. Notably, the application encrypts its responses, ensuring data privacy by preventing visibility on frontend network tabs.</p>
